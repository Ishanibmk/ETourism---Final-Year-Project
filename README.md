# ETourism---Final-Year-Project
Refer -> About.txt for instructions 

Project Overview: 
This project presents an intelligent hybrid framework that combines the Fuzzy Harmony Search (FHS) algorithm with Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in real-time. The system is designed to handle uncertainties in dynamic environments using fuzzy logic and real-time data from IoT devices, improving both the accuracy and adaptability of route optimization for logistics and smart city applications.

Core Technologies:
Fuzzy Logic: Handles uncertainty in distance, cost, and time using Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs).
Harmony Search Algorithm (HSA): A metaheuristic inspired by musical improvisation for solving combinatorial problems like TSP.
IoT Integration: Real-time data input using sensor and GPS emulation.
Python (Flask): Backend implementation and server logic.
Matplotlib : Visualization of city routes and graphs.
HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: Frontend of the E-Tourism Dashboard.
CSV: Lightweight data storage format for city distances and route configurations.

System Features:
Real-time dynamic route planning.
Fuzzy-based distance and time modeling for uncertainty handling.
Adjustable HMCR, PAR, and Bandwidth via fuzzy inference.
Integration of IoT-based inputs like traffic, weather, and GPS.
Graphical dashboard for tour visualization and user interaction.
Modules for tour guide info, accommodation, emergency services, and feedback.
